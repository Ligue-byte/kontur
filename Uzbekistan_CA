<methodology> 
1. Use data for the last 2-5 years for your analysis. 
2. Use data for 2025 or 2024 to calculate capacity.
3. Use information from bills that came into force recently or in 2026. Analyze how they might impact the electronic signature and the entry of Kontur CA into the Uzbek market.
4. Compare competitors' tarifs and pricing plans in three ways: cost per signature, signature types, and signature costs for different segments and roles. Analyze whether the KCR rate is available.
5. Use official sources, statistical data, tax data, competitor websites, EDI operators, and other sources you find that can be considered reliable.
